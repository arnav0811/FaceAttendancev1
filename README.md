# GUI
GUI built using Tkinter library. The GUI provided is a preliminary version consisting only of the Image Capture model in order to create the dataset. 

# Further Imporovements
1. Fixing minor bugs
2. Optimize further for large scale facial recognition
3. Set up frontend web server to connect facial recognition system with a SQL database
4. Build the GUI for other functions
